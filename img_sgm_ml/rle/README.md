# Binary RLE (Run Length Encoding) Implementation

This implementation of RLE is comopatible with thi-ng's rle-pack JavaScript implementation.
[Find it here](https://github.com/thi-ng/umbrella/tree/develop/packages/rle-pack)

Just import the encode and decode function and recieve a much smaller lossless compressed list.

It was tested in 8bit, since the pictures in this project are stored in a 8bit RGB map.
